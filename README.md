# Monkees Project. 

This project is dedicated to a music band called The Monkees. This website will provide the users with information on the band
including a list of playable songs and a video with some information on their albums for reference. 

This website will be targeted towards exsiting Monkees fans and new fans that would like to book the band for any sort of 
events that required. The user will also be informed about the upcoming latest news and shows relating to the band. It will
also inform the users of breif history about the band and what makes them so great. 

## Home page.

## UX

This website is for exsiting Monkees fans as well as new ones that would like to book the band for events such as weddings birthdays etc.
The user would expect to receive news about the band and an idea of what music they would be expecting also they would expect the process of placing
a booking request to be simple and straight forward. This website achives this by clearly labling all the pages that the user can visit at the top
of the page in the order we would expect the user to navigate the page.

* A new Monkees fan would like to know the latest news on the band and can get this information on the home page. They will also be immediately informed that the band is available for bookings. The user would then be able to sign up for the mailing list for latest information sent to them via email. Since they are a new fan they may want to know what music they havent heard, so they can navigate to the music page get a description on each album and have a list of selected tracks to listen to. Once they are have an insight of the music they can the proceed to the booking page to make a request.

* A more seasoned Monkees fan or returning user would like to know the purpose of the website and to know how to book the band. This can be done on the home page through the link in the welcome section or through navigatig to the booking page to place a booking.

* A user would like to listen to some of the band music so they can know what music the band makes. They can do this by going on the music page and playing some of the selected tracks and they have a reference of albums that they can see.

Bellow you'll find a link that shows the initall design of the wire frames but as you can see the design has slightly changed.
For example i have decided to remove the search bar this is because it wouldnt have any functionality and the user can naviagte
to arears within the page that they require through the navbar. 

Also i decided to use the images of the band members on the about page only instead of everypage as this made the header section
look crowded now we have some space in between the navigation icons and the logo.
